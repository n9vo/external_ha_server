# external_ha_server

A lightweight Flask server designed to facilitate real-time interactions with Home Assistant through a custom domain, enhancing accessibility and security without exposing the native Home Assistant interface.

## üîß Features

- **Flask-Based Server**: Utilizes Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, for handling HTTP requests.
- **Cloudflare Integration**: Supports forwarding through Cloudflare to a custom domain.
- **Modular Structure**: Organized into modules for authentication, models, pages, and tunnels.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Enables real-time control and monitoring of Home Assistant entities.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `auth/`: Handles authentication mechanisms.
- `models/`: Defines data models used within the application.
- `modules/`: Contains modular components for various functionalities.
- `pages/`: Manages the web pages served by the Flask application.
- `tunnels/`: Manages tunneling configurations and operations.
- `server.py`: Main entry point for the Flask server.
- `config.json`: Configuration settings for the application.
- `events.json`: Defines events for Home Assistant interactions.
- `logs.json`: Stores logs generated by the application.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies.
- `install.bat`: Batch script to assist with installation.
- `start_tunnels.bat`: Batch script to initiate tunnels. ([Running a Flask Server ¬∑ custom-components pyscript - GitHub](https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript/discussions/283?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Home Assistant instance
- Cloudflare account for domain forwarding ([I have created a python (FLASK) api and want to create an addon ...](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/i-have-created-a-python-flask-api-and-want-to-create-an-addon-related-to-that/177556?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Writing MARKDOWN for your Github README | Analytics Vidhya](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/writing-github-readme-e593f278a796?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
